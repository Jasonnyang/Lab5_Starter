# Lab 5 - Starter
1. No, I would not use a unit test to test the complete "message" feature of a messaging application because it involves multiple components and interactions. Sending a message involes multiple parts of the application and it would be confusing to test everything all at once because you could not pinpoint where the issue was. A unit test is good for testing individual testing but sending a complete message would require other type of tests like integration testing or end-to-end testing to fully check the functionality of the of the program. 

2. Yes, I would use a unit test to test the "max message length" feature of a messaging application. This feature is a good candidate for unit testing because it is a specific, isolated functionality that can be easily tested in isolation. The test would ensure that the application enforces the character limit correctly and handles this limit appropriately. This is a straightforward functionality that does not involve multiple subsystems, making it ideal for a unit test.
